**cinatoken Gateway** is a self-hostable, open-source AI gateway built for agents. It brings together multi-provider models, OpenAI Responses, image generation and editing, ASR / TTS / realtime speech, Agent Tools, and self-hosted or privately deployed AI services behind a single endpoint. Centralized routing, key management, budgets, usage tracking, and auditing make these resources easier to operate, orchestrate, and govern. More than a model proxy, cinatoken provides a centralized, extensible foundation for discovering, invoking, and managing AI capabilities.

**Languages:** [中文](./README.md) · [English](./README.en.md) · [日本語](./README.ja.md) · [한국어](./README.ko.md) · **Repository:** [cinagroup/cinatoken](https://github.com/cinagroup/cinatoken)

## Core Capabilities

cinatoken Gateway is designed to serve as a **unified AI capability hub for one-person companies (OPCs) and enterprises**. It brings multimodal AI resources and tool capabilities under one entry point with enterprise-grade distribution, billing, and operational control.

Its core capabilities include:

1. Provider onboarding: Connect model vendors and aggregation platforms. A large preset catalog, including Coding / Token Plans, lets you import endpoints with one click and then add the corresponding API key. See the repository's [provider import catalog](./packages/admin/lib/provider-import-presets.json); PRs for additional preset Providers are welcome.
2. AI model onboarding: Import models from built-in catalog data without manually configuring common parameters and pricing. See the repository's [model preset catalog](./packages/admin/lib/model-presets/); PRs for additional models are welcome.
3. Multi-protocol access:
    - OpenAI endpoints:
      - Chat Completions: `POST /v1/chat/completions`
      - Responses: `POST /v1/responses`
      - Images: `POST /v1/images/generations`, `POST /v1/images/edits`
      - Audio: `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`, `POST /v1/audio/speech`
      - Models: `GET /v1/models`
    - Anthropic endpoint: `POST /v1/messages`
    - Google Gemini endpoint: `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent` (including `streamGenerateContent`)
    - DashScope realtime audio: `GET /v1/dashscope/realtime`
4. Agent tool access: Use `/v1/tools/*` to expose tools to agents with centralized logging, billing, and cost control, so models and tools share one Gateway:
    - Web search (`POST /v1/tools/web-search`): Bocha, Tavily, Alibaba Cloud CleverSee, Tencent Cloud WSA
    - Web fetch (`POST /v1/tools/web-fetch`): Firecrawl, Tavily Extract, Jina Reader
    - Deep search (`POST /v1/tools/web-deep-search`, search + read): Firecrawl Search, Jina Search
    - AI-content detection (`POST /v1/tools/ai-detection`): Tencent Cloud TMS is implemented, with a multi-engine catalog ready for expansion
    - More Agent tools are planned, and contributions are welcome.
5. Unified AI capability endpoint: All connected models, platforms, and tools are exposed through the deployed cinatoken Gateway Base URL, so clients only need to remember one endpoint.
6. Multiple routing strategies: When a model has several upstream resources, choose the strategy that best matches the workload:
    - `hash_affinity`: Default; keeps the same user, model, and protocol on a stable upstream for a **high prompt-cache hit rate** and session continuity, though short-term traffic may be uneven
    - `weighted_random`: Weighted random distribution with **strong load balancing**, suitable for proportional cost allocation or A/B testing; users may switch Providers more often, reducing cache hits
    - `weight_priority`: Deterministic ordering from highest to lowest weight, suitable for explicit primary / backup behavior; the first Provider receives most traffic
    - `weighted_round_robin`: Weighted rotation for more even distribution; counters are maintained per runtime instance and are not globally synchronized across instances
7. Integrated user management and accounting:
    - Three-level External system, User, and API Key hierarchy: the external-system field separates systems or teams, while API Keys authenticate calls and drive charging and auditing
    - Three ledgers: every invocation records catalog price, actual provider cost, and user charge separately
    - Time-of-day multipliers: peak / off-peak pricing, including weekday vs weekend rates, improves cost accuracy and enables flexible customer pricing and promotions
8. Admin console and management APIs:
    - Full Admin UI and APIs for manual operation or integration with other portals
    - Observability and analytics for request details, statistics, and operational analysis
    - Playground / Simulator for quickly validating Provider, model, route, and client configurations
9. Flexible deployment:
    - Free deployment on **Cloudflare Workers + D1**
    - Docker deployment with Postgres / MySQL

## How It Differs from Other Open-Source AI Gateways

[New API](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api), [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), [Sub2API](https://github.com/Wei-Shaw/sub2api), and [Bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost) are mature open-source AI gateways with different strengths. cinatoken focuses more specifically on **Agent capability delivery and AI resource operations**, with its main differences concentrated in five areas:

| Focus area | Built-in cinatoken mechanism | Best suited for |
|---|---|---|
| Agent capabilities | Web search, web fetch, deep search, plus tool invocation logs and billing | Serving models and tools to Agents through one gateway |
| Resource onboarding | Provider / model presets, multi-protocol endpoints, and one-click import | Managing distributed AI resources centrally |
| Fine-grained routing | Independent route pools, layered policies, cache affinity, failover, and circuit breaking | Balancing reliability, cache hit rate, and cost |
| Operations and billing | Three ledgers for catalog price, provider cost, and user charge, with time-of-day and multimodal pricing | Internal accounting, quota management, or external services |
| Flexible deployment | Docker with multiple databases, or Cloudflare Workers with D1 | Self-hosting, edge deployment, and low-cost adoption |

**Rating guide:**

- **✅ Complete**: The public edition provides a cohesive mechanism covering the main scenarios in this dimension
- **🟡 Strong**: Mature core support, with comparatively narrower coverage or operational depth
- **🟠 Basic**: A usable foundation that still requires substantial external components or custom development
- **⚪ None**: Official public documentation does not list a comparable built-in capability

Ratings are based on each project's current public repository and official documentation, with emphasis on whether the capability is built in as a cohesive mechanism. Performance, community size, commercial support, and custom-development potential are out of scope. This comparison reflects cinatoken's product positioning rather than ranking every feature across all projects. Refer to each project's latest official documentation for current capabilities and licensing.

## Quick Start

Requires **Node.js 20+**. Run Proxy and Admin concurrently in **two terminals**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cinagroup/cinatoken.git
cd cinatoken
npm install
npm run db:migrate
```

Terminal 1 — Proxy (`:8787`):

```bash
npm run dev:proxy
```

Terminal 2 — Admin (`:8789`):

```bash
npm run dev:admin
```

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Proxy | http://127.0.0.1:8787 | Inference endpoint |
| Admin | http://127.0.0.1:8789 | Console; local default credentials: **`admin` / `admin`** |

The first `dev:admin` run creates `packages/admin/.dev.vars`. Open Admin, configure a Provider, Route, and user API key, then call Proxy with that key. See [docs/users/quickstart.md](./docs/users/quickstart.md) for detailed steps and `curl` examples.

### Deploy to Cloudflare

```bash
npx wrangler login
npm run bootstrap:cloudflare
```

See [Cloudflare quickstart](./docs/operators/deployment/cloudflare-quickstart.md). Before production, change the default Admin password and create a named least-privilege Admin API Key for each external integration.

For Docker self-hosting and Postgres / MySQL options, see the [deployment documentation index](./docs/operators/deployment/README.md).
